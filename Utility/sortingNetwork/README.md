# Sorting Network Code

To run this script you must have python and IDLE (python IDE) installed

To install go to <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.

Once you have python installed here are the instructions.

* Download this repository by clicking on the green button above or by using git in the terminal

## Input
* Once you have it downloaded and unziped the project. Open the network.txt file.
* Input is as follows
..1. first line is the number of lines in network `5`
..1. second line is the network swaps `[[(0,1),(2,3)],[(0,2)],[(1,3)],[(1,2),(3,4)],[(1,3)],[(0,1),(2,3)]]`

### Keep in mind that the number of lines is zero indexed

for example this network:

Input is:
1. `8`
2. `[[(0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7)],[(0,3),(4,7)],[(1,2),(5,6)],[(0,1),(2,3),(6,7)],[(0,7)],[(1,6)],[(2,5)],[(3,4)],[(0,2),(4,6)],[(1,3),(5,7)],[(0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7)]]`

Another example:
![alt text](https://github.com/abasnfarah/sortingNetwork/blob/master/img/SortingNetwork2.png "file 2")

Input is:
1. `5`
2. `[[(0,1),(2,3)],[(0,2)],[(1,3)],[(1,2),(3,4)],[(1,3)],[(0,1),(2,3)]]`
