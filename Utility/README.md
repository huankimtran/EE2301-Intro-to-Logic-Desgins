# EE2301-Intro-to-Logic-Desgins
Some utilities to use on exam including: <br/>
* Timing Analysis - help with creating arrival time table
* Moore and Mealy machine - help with converting a Moore or Mealy State Diagram to their logic gates implementation (logic expressions for each inputs,outputs, internal bits) using JK flip flop and D flip flop
* XNF form implementation - Implement a function using XOR XNF form given its the function truth table
